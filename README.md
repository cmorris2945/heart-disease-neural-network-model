# heart-disease-neural-network-model
This is  a neural with one hidden layer and an input and an output layer.
This project will focus on predicting heart disease using neural networks. Based on attributes such as blood pressure,
cholestoral levels, heart rate, and other characteristic attributes, patients will be classified according to varying degrees of coronary artery disease.
This project will utilize a dataset of 303 patients from the Yale University Department of Cardiology.
